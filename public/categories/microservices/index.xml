      <description>Context  DISCLAIMER: I decided to not continue with this due to the huge implications that will be to do everything in VMs, baed.sically, a lot of time should be invest
 In order to practice for the CKA exam, it is recommended to perform the famous Kubernetes The Hard Way by Kelsey Hightower.
That guide is one of the best way to create a Kubernetes cluster by installing each component of them separatedly instead of using other tools like Kind, MiniKube, etc.</description>

      <description>OSS monitoring series Context If you work with micro-services (maybe not) and in the cloud (or not), you have probably heard about the many products for monitoring (or monitoring stacks), the most &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; and famous OSS are:
 ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) Grafana stack (Grafana, Loki and Prometheus)  All these products are open-source projects which have become the go-to for many companies and I can deny that they work well (at least in my experience) especially for services built in the cloud or micro-services.</description>
