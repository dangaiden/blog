Wow, seems unbelievable but It's been already a YEAR since I joined VMware!

Yes, in **June 20th I started working in a new company, VMware**, which most of people in IT will know because of the hypervisor revolution about 20 years ago or so ;)


### Why?

Well, if you're reading this, chances are that you know that I've been around the #vCommunity for years and well, I've been working a lot with VMware products (basically since I started in IT, more than 10 years ago!).

I am still a vExpert but no longer a VMUG Leader and although I haven't touched anything VMware related since 2019 (as I moved twice), I still retain some of the knowledge which helps a bit I guess plus, I liked some of the VMware products, especially, the well known Hypervisor ESXim which is widely spread on many DCs.

Therefore, why I decided to move?

Although **I aimed for this company years ago** and now wasn't my main target, once I saw the role and how it was related to Tanzu, it was a clear yes for me.

My team, Tanzu Platform Labs Service, is dedicated to enable customers with Tanzu and anything related to Kubernetes (or any other cloud-native technology) but we know the buzzword/famous one is K8s.

### Uncertainity

Regarding this uncertainity about the Broadcom acquisition and so, well, I can tell you I decided to join even after knowing it was going to be acquired.

Was it a good decision? 

Time will tell but I am betting that the **Tanzu portfolio is one of the best things that VMware has as company**, hopefully Broadcom won't do anything but I am just speaking out loud : )

Meanwhile I am learning a lot from the customers and teammates where I work everyday so I can't complain about my current situation.

### My experience so far

I am enjoying this role within the Tanzu Plaform Labs services team, a team which not only focuses on everything related Tanzu but enabling the customers with DevOps methodologies, Agile practices, etc to embrace Kubernetes in the best way.

Sounds like a sales-pitch but I like that I am not exclusively tied to teach how a product like Tanzu works.

Besides that I have the opportunity to work deploying other OSS projects (like Harbor, Contour, cert-manager, etc.) plus teaching methodologies to companies which are embracing Kubernetes for their first time or have little experience with it.
