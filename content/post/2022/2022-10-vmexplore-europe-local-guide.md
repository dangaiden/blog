>This is a "remake" from my previous guide and maybe I have missed something which is not properly updated.

VMworld 2022 Europe is one month away and I am excited because that means the first event that I am going to attend this year (after not being able to attend Kubecon in Valencia...)

This is a remake of my previous guide with tips about transport, restaurants, places to go, etc. I am trying to update as much as I can but also I won't extend as much as I did in my 2019 guide.

## General information

The event will take place from the 7th (Monday) to 10th (Thursday) of November at "https://cutt.ly/4eoPvEw">Fira Gran Via in Barcelona, Spain.

VMworld is always an amazing opportunity to learn from all the events that will happen there like the Hands-on Lab, Breakout sessions, General sessions, etc.

Also, it is a great way to connect with a lot of people from the community, vendors or other persons that you are interested in.

People are really friendly so, don't be shy (you can try first on Twitter!) and try to speak to members from the vCommunity (if you you don't know what it is just search for #vCommunity on Twitter!). Besides, be sure to meet the vBrownbag crew (which I am part of) in the Tech talks area ðŸ™‚

### Some notes

In Spain, tipping is entirely optional and its not very common so, it's up to you if you want to leave a tip in case the service was exceptional or you think it deserves it. 

In restaurants, shops, etc. the VAT tax is included. Therefore, you don't have to worry to calculate an extra amount of money. 

Also, once you pay with credit card (VISA branded cards are the most used here) they will make you enter the PIN code of your credit card (a bit different than the US).

I know it's late but, hotels near Fira are nice and a bit expensive. The best zone I think it is near Sants where there are cheaper hotels, nice transport connections, and great ambient.

The official language in Barcelona is Spanish but most of the population speak in Catalan. Saying that, don't worry if you don't understand some signboards from the street or public places.

## Transportation

There are 3 different train services: Renfe (Local Train), TMB (metro/subway/underground) and FGC (Regional Train).

Renfe and TMB are the most used because they have more combinations than the FGC and also better schedules. So, basically, you will see in this guide mentioning train for Renfe and metro/subway/underground for TMB.

### Coming from the airport

Once you land at El Prat airport, there are a few ways to go to the city of Barcelona:

  * You can take a taxi (expensive but more convenient for people with less time or when the hotel is located in an isolated area). It will costs between 30-40 â‚¬ from the Barcelona Airport to *Sants* (always depending on the traffic). Put the hand luggage on the taxi trunk costs an additional euro. One of the services available is *FreeNow* as *Uber* and Cabifiy are not available in Barcelona.

  *By train, service called [Renfe](https://www.renfe.com/content/dam/renfe/es/Viajeros/Secciones/Cercanias/Mapas/barcelona.png)

  You can go to the *Aeroport* (airport) stop on the *R2 Nord* line (you must go to Terminal 2 to take the train). This line will take you to Sants-Estacio and will be great for people staying near Sants. 

  This line is less frequent than the next option but it takes less time. Pricing is subjected to zones. In that case, From Aeroport to Sants-Estacio the price for a single ticket will be 4.60 â‚¬.


  *By metro/subway ("https://www.tmb.cat/documents/20182/96078/Pl%C3%A0nol+xarxa+de+Metro/f5578f40-5a66-46ba-907c-cf31e0d368c0">TMB):


  Use the *L9 Sud* line, this is the Metro (subway/underground) service and can be combined with other lines (like L5 at *Collblanc* stop for example) within the same ticket.

  This  service is more frequent than the train service. This can be the best option for most people because you can use the same single ticket to go to other places by combining lines.


By bus (*Aerobus* service): 


The least recommended option as it will be crowded but it depends on your preferences and where do you want to go. 


The *Aerobus* service will take you to *Â«PlaÃ§a CatalunyaÂ»* (Catalunya Plaza) but it costs a bit more than other services (still 5,90 â‚¬ in 2022), you can review more information [here](https://www.aeropuertobarcelona-elprat.com/ingl/accesos_aeropuerto_taxi_bus4030.htm#aerobus-A1-A2).

### Moving inside of Barcelona

The Metro (subway/underground) is your best choice whatever you stay in Barcelona if you want a cheaper, frequent and reliable service.

With the metro (remember the name) you can travel through lines at the same cost. The main stops to consider will be Fira in L9 Sud, PlaÃ§a Espanya in L1/L3 and Sants-Estacio in L5/L3.

### The fastest way to VMware Explore?

The closest stop to the VMware Explore event is *Fira* in *L9 Sud* or the *Europa-Fira* stop which is another stop from the L9-Sud line that also combines with another [train service](https://www.fgc.cat/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/planol_2019.pdf) which is a different transport service than the metro and it has different stops.

>If you stay near *Sants*, the *Sants-Estacio* stop in *L5* will be your choice. Then, in Sants-Estacio station take the *L5* to *Collblanc* stop and after that, change the line to *L9 Sud* until you arrive at Fira stop.

You can see in the following map the VMware ExploreÂ precinct highlighted in yellow and the closest stops (marked in: Europa-Fira stop which combines FGC and Metro services and, Fira stop at L9 Sud.

Also, avoid the neighborhood known as Â«La MinaÂ» which is farther from Barcelona but it still accessible by Metro.
                                            
                                            
### Restaurants

The food in Barcelona is nice and some of you probably know it.

Let me suggest a couple of restaurants near Fira Gran Via (VMworld):
"https://bit.ly/35tkurS">Gran Varela: A restaurant with great food (especially octopus). Also, the wines are great!

In Gran Via 2 (a shopping center pretty close to Fira Gran via) I can suggest you: 
 
A great Japanese (Udon)
                                                  
                                                  
A good Italian (La Tagliatella)Â 
                                                  
                                                  
Beers and tapas (CaÃ±as y tapa)

"https://cutt.ly/dep2q9r">Restaurant La Vid: A nice restaurant where you can try local food like the bread with spread tomato, the Spanish omelet, or the ham! This is also the restaurant that will be hosting the vBreakfast event on Tuesday morning.

**** The best places aren't near Fira Gran Via but if you want to try better food, here are a couple of restaurants that are really nice:


 "https://www.bacoaburger.com/en/">Bacoa Burger: Amazing and customized burgers, also hand-made fries and sauces.

 "https://www.konig.cat/en/">KÃ¶nig: Amazing restaurant where you can try almost everything: tapas, amazing beer, flatbread, and many other options!


 "http://www.bellanapoli.es/en/">La Bella Napoli: Not many choices on the menu in this Italian restaurant but the food quality is amazing.

 "http://bairesbcn.com/">Buenos Aires Grill Restaurant: Steak, ribs, Argentinian Beef, special cuts?
 
 "https://www.facebook.com/RamenYaHiro">Ramen-Ya Hiro: Best ramen in Barcelona without a doubt! The queue won't be short to get the Ramen&#8230;  

### Local food

Let me put a short section about local food here. The food you must try while staying here would be: Paella, Spanish omelet, Bread with (spread) tomato and of course Ham (JamÃ³n)!

Despite there many restaurants that they prepare all these dishes, I will avoid the ones in Las Ramblas because they're usually not the best option&#8230;

Bread with (spread) tomato can be found in almost any bar or restaurant so, just ask for it. They are also served at breakfast!<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1236 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pa_amb_tomaquet2.jpg" alt="pa_amb_tomaquet" width="558" height="318" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pa_amb_tomaquet2.jpg 700w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pa_amb_tomaquet2-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px" />

If you don't want to lose a lot of time by going far from VMworld to taste many of these dishes, I would suggest you go "https://cutt.ly/dep2q9r">Restaurant La Vid, which I talked in the previous section.

 Also, on these dates, it is common for street vendors to sell hot toasted chestnuts wrapped in newspaper, give it a try!

Finally, within this season, you should try a sweety called Â«panelletsÂ» (special almond balls covered in pine nuts), you can find them in bakeries:


![Panellets](https://www.cocinaabuenashoras.com/files/panellets-de-pinones-2-1024x575.jpg)

There are many other places and foods not included here. If you want something specific just let me know in the comments or via DM on "https://twitter.com/DanGaiden">Twitter.

## Conclusion

That will be a summary of things to do at VMware Explore and in the city of Barcelona.

Be sure to enjoy VMworld with all the events, parties, people and more things that can give you but overall, have fun!

If you think that something is missing, let me know.

See you at VMworld, sorry, I meant VMware Explore ;)
