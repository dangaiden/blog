<span >Finally, after some time... I am writing something here.</span>

<span >It's being almost 5 months since I wrote my last blog post and it happened so fast but my final project kept me quite busy between November '20 and January '21.</span>

<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1884 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fallout-fallout-4-vault-boy-green-wallpaper-preview.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="326" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fallout-fallout-4-vault-boy-green-wallpaper-preview.jpg 728w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fallout-fallout-4-vault-boy-green-wallpaper-preview-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /> 

<span >After finishing my bachelor's degree final project in January, I've been enjoying some free time for myself and with that, I Â«forgotÂ» about writing (a.k.a. procrastination) but not anymore as I plan to start again writing as I did in the past.</span>

<span ><em>More on that project and the bachelor's degree in the next blog posts!</em></span>

<span >Getting to the point&#8230; I am writing this because finally, after waiting for 5 months (internal arrangements) I am moving to another position! So I am changing the role but not the company.</span>

<span >Therefore, since today, <strong>I'll be a Â«Cloud SREÂ» within NTT</strong>.</span>

# Cloud what?

<span >Wait...what the hell is Â«Cloud SREÂ»? </span>

<span >I know...it's a weird name but it's the official name for the position. Probably a better name would be Cloud Automation Engineer (or similar) as I am not going to work with developers in pipelines and helping them closely.</span>

<span >I'll be working with technologies and tools like Git, Ansible, Terraform, Packer, and more. </span>

<span >Containers and Kubernetes (very well known) are also on the menu but the biggest change for me will be the infrastructure. </span>

<span >I'll be working only with cloud providers, specifically GCP and Azure, for now, we will see later.</span>

# Challenges ahead

<span >Well, it could sound just a mere position change but for me, it would be a huge one. </span>

<span >From using VMware, Microsoft and some Linux technologies mainly in on-premises infrastructures to mainly Linux with Git, Ansible plus containers in the cloud will be a huge change (which I am eager to start!). </span>

<span >So basically Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which is a more common thing these days and quite convenient for the cloud.</span>

<span >This doesn't mean I won't be posting more VMware things but probably more container-ish, cloud (GCP and Azure), and probably Linux things as I will be learning a lot of them ðŸ™‚</span>

_**<span >P.S. This change will have a massive impact on my Windows to Linux journey which I expect to write some of it shortly!</span>**_
